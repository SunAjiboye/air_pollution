Customizing the Scatter Plot (Ozone vs. Solar Radiation):

Here's how you can tweak the scatter plot:

1. Change Point Style:
   - Use `pch` to change the shape of the points.
   ```R
   plot(airquality$Solar.R, airquality$Ozone, 
        xlab = "Solar Radiation", ylab = "Ozone Levels", 
        main = "Ozone vs. Solar Radiation", 
        pch = 16, col = "blue") # Use filled circles
   ```

2. Modify Colors:
   - Use `col` to customize point and line colors.
   ```R
   plot(airquality$Solar.R, airquality$Ozone, 
        col = "forestgreen") # Change point color
   abline(lm(Ozone ~ Solar.R, data = airquality), col = "darkorange") # Change trendline color
   ```

3. Add Gridlines
 ```R
   grid(col = "lightgray", lty = "dotted") # Add a gray dotted grid
   ```

4. Change Axis Scale:
   - Use `xlim` and `ylim` to adjust axis limits.
   ```R
   plot(airquality$Solar.R, airquality$Ozone, 
        xlim = c(0, 350), ylim = c(0, 150)) # Set specific axis ranges
   ```

# Customizing the Box Plot (Ozone Levels by Month):

Here are customization ideas for the box plot:

1. Modify Colors:
   - Change the color palette for the boxes.
   ```R
   boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, 
           col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen", "lightpink", "lightyellow", "lightgray"))
   ```

2. Label the Axes:
   - Add descriptive labels to the axes for better clarity.
   ```R
   boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, 
           xlab = "Month (May to September)", ylab = "Ozone Levels (ppb)")
   ```

3. Add Notches:
   - Add notches to compare medians across groups.
   ```R
   boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, 
           notch = TRUE, main = "Notched Boxplot: Ozone Levels by Month")
   ```

4. Rotate X-axis Labels:
   - Adjust axis labels for better readability.
   ```R
   boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality)
   axis(1, at = 1:5, labels = c("May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep"), las = 2) # Rotate labels
   ```

Here are some possible insights you could derive from the visualizations of the `airquality` dataset:

---

1. Scatter Plot (Ozone vs. Solar Radiation):
- Positive Relationship: The scatter plot may reveal that higher Solar Radiation (`Solar.R`) often corresponds to higher Ozone (`Ozone`) levels, suggesting a positive correlation.
- Outliers: Points far from the trendline could indicate days with unusual Ozone or Solar Radiation levels, possibly influenced by unique weather events or measurement errors.
- Clustering: If data points form clusters, it may indicate specific conditions or periods when certain Ozone levels are more frequent.

---

 2. Box Plot (Ozone Levels by Month):
- Monthly Variations: The box plot could show clear differences in median Ozone levels across months, with values potentially peaking in the summer months (June, July, August).
- Outliers: The plot highlights outliers, which could represent exceptionally high or low Ozone levels on specific days.
- Spread of Data: Wider boxes or whiskers indicate greater variability in Ozone levels for specific months.

By examining these visualizations, one can identify seasonal trends, periods of high or low air pollution, and factors that might influence Ozone levels, like Solar Radiation or other environmental variables.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
